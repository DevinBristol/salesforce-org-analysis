# Salesforce Org Context

## Business Overview
**Company:** 
Bristol Windows Inc - (Lincoln, NE) www.bristolnebraska.com
**Industry:** 
Residential Window Replacement (Some Commercial work such as Retirement Homes, Churches, and Government buildings)
**Users:** 
Inside Sales team (Progressive Dialer (Five9))
Admin
Development team (Salesforce Development, API work, Automation)

These following pain points and priorities are not all encompassing. The #1 Goal is profit by increasing revenue and building efficient systems.
Devin operates the business and leads the entire sales team (inside and out), the development team, the marketing team (manages multiple agencies contracted to run ppc/seo/branding/etc. for Bristol Windows)
The single largest issue in the business is its reliance on Devin and the time he sinks into everyday tasks / development / IT work / project management. This keeps him from strategizing on improving the business and stuck in the day to day.


## Pain Points
0. Hours spent on Development and manual excel/google sheets work is massively gating ROI
1. Multiple disconnected or poorly connected Systems (Salesforce, CompanyCam, Five9, Birdeye, Boomerang, Excel, Googlesheets) causing repeat data entry, poor data, comunication drops, inablity to build reliable automation. Need Salesforce as source of truth.
2. User adoption - Need to get Operations Manager and Finance Manager using Salesforce by making Salesforce useful to them so they can update data by simply using it. (Finance Status, Ordered jobs, Installed Jobs, repairs calls, invoicing). 
3. Org isnt user intuitive. Set up is a mess, with many bugs in production. Need to simplify the org and tailor it to each end user.

## Priorities
1. Increase Contact Rate / Quality Data for cold calling (Need automated systems for ANI reputation management, Data hygiene and enrichment to build lists of quality leads for cold outreach) 
2. Automate as much as possible. (Build tools to reduce real world tasks : i.e. see rundown export)
3. Unify Systems
